# Basic Image Analysis with Python

This repository contains fundamental techniques and examples for image analysis, with a focus on bioimaging applications. These methods were originally developed during a course I took on image analysis and include practical tools and concepts commonly used in the field.

## Features
- **Basic Techniques**:
  - Image segmentation

  - Spot detection

  - sklearn
    
![sklearn](./example/sklearn.png)

  - Image alignment

- **Libraries Used**:
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
  - [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)

## Applications
These techniques are particularly useful for processing biological images, such as analyzing cell images, detecting objects of interest, and performing basic image transformations.
